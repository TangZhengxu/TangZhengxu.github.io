## About Me

Hi! This is **Zhengxu Tang** (唐正旭). I am currently a senior at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu), pursuing a double major in **Mathematical Sciences - Operations Research and Modeling** and **Statistics**. 

At present, I'm engaged as a research assistant in the [Biomedical AI Lab](https://liyueshen.engin.umich.edu/), under the guidance of Dr. Liyue Shen. Previously, I worked in the [Li Lab](https://www.labli.net/), mentored by Dr. Jinxing Li. 

Should you share similar interests or consider potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me at tangzx@umich.edu. I'd love to engage in discussions and explore opportunities for collaboration.

## Research Interests

- **AI for Bio-Medical** 
- **AI for Science**
- **AI for Brain-Computer Interface** 

My current research focuses on building a multimodal model based on multiple types of medical data, such as medical images, genomics data, EHRs, and so on. I am particularly interested in Multimodal Learning and its applications in the Biomedical field. Human process various modes of information-including sight, sound, smell, and touch-constantly, and this information shapes our cognition and understanding of the world. Everything is interconnected. For this reason, I firmly believe that multimodal deep learning models are the most effective tools for addressing biomedical problems. l am committed to devoting my skills and expertise to this meaningful endeavor, with the aim of contributing to societal well-being
